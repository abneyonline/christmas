# Christmas in Physics-on-Sea

Created for the [secret santa jam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/secret-santa), I got a giftee who reminded me a lot of myself. At the age of 13 I too was messing around in free tools like Unity to create games. I still do this, all these years later, which is why we're here. A recurring theme of my earliest projects was physics, different gravity, etc. I've attempted to reignite the spirit of those projects with Christmas in Physics-on-Sea, though admittedly not as feature rich as I would like, I feel there are decent bones here. I attempted to develop the game in such a way that it could be easily understood and extended. This is part of the gift to my giftee. The opportunity to take a look at a project that a person with more development experience might create. Which is not to say that I believe this project is an indelible, perfect creation, rather I believe it is a human one.

So, to my giftee, and to one and all, take a look at my creation, see where I made puzzling decisions and unintentional mistakes, see my triumphs and my failures.
